#### Description

***readSTARlogsFinalOut*** is an R function which takes as its input the location of a directory containing the log.final.out files produced by STAR (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) and produces a dataframe of tidy data from those files.

***makeSTARreport*** is an R function which takes as its input a dataframe produced by ***readSTARlogsFinalOut*** and depicts several columns of this data frame as bar plots. Those columns are 

* Number of input reads
* Uniquely mapped reads number
* Uniquely mapped reads %
* % of reads mapped to multiple loci

***samples.lab =*** An additional argument of ***makeSTARreport*** which labels the x-axis of the bar plots and defaults to the path of the log.final.out file.
